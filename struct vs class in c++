### Differences Between Structure and Class in C++

In C++, structures (`struct`) and classes (`class`) are very similar in syntax and usage, but they differ in some fundamental ways:

| **Feature**                                     | **Class**                                            | **Structure**                                       |
|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Default Member Access**                        | Private                                               | Public                                               |
| **Instance Name**                                | Object                                               | Structure Variable                                   |
| **Member Visibility**                            | Private by default                                    | Public by default                                    |
| **Keyword Used for Declaration**                 | `class`                                              | `struct`                                             |
| **Usage**                                        | Data abstraction, inheritance                         | Grouping of data                                     |
| **NULL Values**                                  | Possible                                              | Not possible                                          |
| **Inheritance**                                  | Supported                                             | Supported                                             |
| **Syntax**                                       | ```cpp class ClassName { <br> private: <br> member1; <br> member2; <br> public: <br> member3; <br> ... <br> memberN; <br> }; ``` | ```cpp struct StructureName { <br> member1; <br> member2; <br> ... <br> memberN; <br> }; ``` |

#### Examples Demonstrating Differences:

1. **Default Member Access**:

   - **Class Example**: Members are private by default.
     ```cpp
     class Test {
         int x; // private by default
     };
     // Accessing x here would cause a compilation error
     ```
   
   - **Structure Example**: Members are public by default.
     ```cpp
     struct Test {
         int x; // public by default
     };
     // Accessing x here is valid
     ```
   
2. **Keyword for Declaration**:

   - **Class Example**:
     ```cpp
     class ClassName {
         // Members and methods
     };
     ```
   
   - **Structure Example**:
     ```cpp
     struct StructureName {
         // Members
     };
     ```
   
3. **Inheritance**:

   - **Class Example**:
     ```cpp
     class Parent {
     public:
         int x;
     };
     
     class Child : public Parent {
     public:
         int y;
     };
     ```
   
   - **Structure Example**:
     ```cpp
     struct Base {
         int x;
     };
     
     struct Derived : Base {
         int y;
     };
     ```

### Summary

- **Class**: Focuses on data abstraction and supports inheritance, with members private by default.
- **Structure**: Primarily used for grouping data and members are public by default.

These differences dictate their usage in various programming scenarios, allowing programmers to choose the appropriate structure (`struct`) or class (`class`) based on the encapsulation and inheritance requirements of their design.
