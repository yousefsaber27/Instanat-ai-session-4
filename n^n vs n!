### \( n^n \) Time Complexity

**Example**: Generating all subsets of a set of \( n \) elements.

**Explanation**:
- Each element in the set can either be included or excluded from a subset independently.
- Therefore, there are \( 2^n \) possible subsets because each of the \( n \) elements has 2 choices (include or exclude).

**Time Complexity**: \( O(2^n) \), which simplifies to \( O(n^n) \) for large \( n \) because \( 2^n \) is asymptotically equivalent to \( n^n \).

### \( n! \) Time Complexity

**Example**: Generating all permutations of a set of \( n \) elements.

**Explanation**:
- There are \( n! \) possible permutations of \( n \) elements (i.e., factorial growth).

**Time Complexity**: \( O(n!) \), where each permutation involves \( n \) elements arranged in a different order.

### Summary

- **\( n^n \) complexity**: Each element's independent choice (like including or excluding) leads to exponential growth in computations.
- **\( n! \) complexity**: Involves factorial growth due to generating permutations or combinations of elements.

In practical terms, \( n^n \) complexity algorithms are more computationally intensive compared to \( n! \) complexity for large \( n \). This distinction helps in understanding the scalability and performance implications of different algorithms on varying input sizes.
